# Lead_Score_Case_Study
## Problem Statement:

X Education, an online education company, faces the challenge of low lead conversion rates despite receiving a significant number of leads on a daily basis. Out of 100 leads acquired, only about 30 convert into paying customers. To address this issue and improve efficiency, the company aims to identify the most promising leads, also known as "Hot Leads." By focusing on these leads, the sales team can prioritize their efforts and increase the overall lead conversion rate.

In the lead generation process, a multitude of professionals express interest by visiting the website, browsing courses, filling out forms, and watching videos. Leads are obtained from various sources, including website visitors, form submissions, and referrals from past customers. The sales team then engages with these leads through calls, emails, and other means of communication to convert them into paying customers.

To achieve a higher lead conversion rate, it is crucial to nurture and engage potential leads during the middle stage of the conversion funnel. This involves educating them about the courses, maintaining constant communication, and addressing their specific needs and concerns. By providing personalized attention and valuable information, the chances of converting these potential leads into paying customers significantly increase.

To assist X Education in identifying the most promising leads, we will develop a lead scoring model. This model will assign a lead score to each potential customer, indicating their likelihood of converting into a paying customer. The higher the lead score, the greater the chance of conversion. This approach allows the sales team to focus their efforts on leads with higher scores, maximizing their chances of success.

The CEO has set a target lead conversion rate of around 80%, and the lead scoring model will be designed to align with this objective. By analyzing various factors such as lead source, website interaction, form submissions, referrals, and communication history, the model will predict the conversion probability for each lead. By prioritizing communication and nurturing the leads with higher scores, the sales team can allocate their resources more effectively and increase the overall conversion rate.

Continuous monitoring and evaluation of the lead scoring model's performance will be essential. Regular analysis of the model's accuracy and adjustments based on feedback will ensure its effectiveness in identifying the most potential leads. This iterative process will enable X Education to optimize their sales efforts, improve lead conversion rates, and achieve the desired growth and success.

By implementing the lead scoring model and adopting a focused approach towards promising leads, X Education can increase their conversion rates, enhance the efficiency of their sales process, and ultimately realize their goal of capturing a larger market share in the online education industry.

## Goals of the Case Study

For this case study, there are a few goals:

The company is required to build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score to each of the leads between 0 and 100 that can be used by the company for the purpose of targeting potential leads. If the lead score is higher, it would mean that the lead is hot, i.e., it has the highest chance of converting, while if the score is lower, it would mean that the lead is cold and is unlikely to convert.

There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to handle if the company's requirements change in the future, so you will need to address these issues at the same time. These problems are provided in a separate doc file that can be found in the download section. In the first step you obtained a logistic regression model and you would like to fill it out based on that model. It will also be very important for you to include this in your final PPT where you will be giving recommendations to your audience.
